	 * IMPORTANTE NOTE 1
	 * 
	 * The collections (List, Set) did not have the stream() method.
	 * This was added by the implementation of default methods.
	 * SO, all the programs, libraries, codes, etc... that were created using that interface ... 
	 * now have that method accessible but they do not need to implement that method.
	 * */
	
	/*
	 * IMPORTANTE NOTE 1
	 * If there are default methods on interfaces .. and a class can extend multiple interfaces .. this means:
	 * There is a form of multiple inheritance in Java.
